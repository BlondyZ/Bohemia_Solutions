### Added
- Central ReloadAllUserConfigs() to reload configs.json, sp_configs.json, filters_global.json, paths.json, and optional config.json in one shot.
- Automatic reload of all user configs on app startup and again right after the update check completes.
- ChangeLogEditor now propagates changelog.json to the project root and to Content/ automatically on Save (for update packaging).

### Changed
- PathSettingsService now supports ReloadFromDisk() to re-read paths.json without restarting the app.

### Fixed
- Missing/empty Id values in configs.json are auto-generated and persisted during reload.
- Stale paths after in-place updates; paths are now reloaded from disk to prevent mismatches.

### Improved
- UI refresh hooks: MP/SP lists and filter selectors are reliably refreshed after a reload.
- Dynamic project-root discovery (no hard-coded paths) when copying changelog.json.

### Stability
- Reload errors are caught and shown as a single warning dialog so startup isn’t blocked.
