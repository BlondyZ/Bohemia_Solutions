### Added
- Post-update launch now requests Administrator via UAC; if declined, app falls back to non-elevated start.

### Changed
- Update script starts the new version with --post-update argument for future post-update hooks.
- Overlay is hosted directly on the form with Dock=Fill and recalculates layout on every resize.

### Fixed
- Update overlay (spinner + text) is now perfectly centered on all window sizes and in maximized mode.
